OBJECTIVE
Destroy the enemy's foundation unit by invading it with your own tiles.

BEFORE THE FIRST ROUND
Each player has to choose a location for their foundation unit before the game starts.
Your foundation unit must be touching your side of the grid.

WHEN IT'S YOUR TURN
You must do only one of the following:
a) Place a normal tile
    - You can only place a tile touching one of your own tiles.
    If you have no tiles, the tile must be touching your foundation unit.
b) Destroy an enemy tile
    - To destroy a single enemy tile you need to place two of your tiles on the enemy tile.
    - This has to be done over two turns, however these turns do not need to be back-to-back.
    - The enemy can never regain a destroyed tile.
c) Invade the enemy's foundation
    - If you have a tile next to the enemy's foundation unit, you can invade the foundation
    by placing one of your tiles inside the foundation unit. When the foundation unit is
    covered with your tiles, you win the game.
    - You may use one single large tile to win in one turn.

LARGE TILES
- When you get three normal tiles in a line (either straight or diagonal),
you get a large tile. A large tile's size is 2x2 tiles and must be placed immediately.
- A tile may only be used once in each direction to make a large tile.
- It is not possible to create large tiles using large tiles.

MISCELLANEOUS
- If you make it impossible for the enemy to invade your foundation, you lose.
