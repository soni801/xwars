OBJECTIVE
Destroy the enemy's foundation unit.

BEFORE THE FIRST ROUND
Each player has to choose a location for their foundation unit before the game starts.
Your foundation unit must be touching your side of the grid.

WHEN IT'S YOUR TURN
You can do only one of the following:
a) Place a normal tile
    - You can only place a tile touching one of your own tiles.
    If you have none, the tile must be touching your foundation unit.
b) Destroy an enemy tile
    - Destroying an enemy tile means placing your tile on top of an enemy tile.
    You must place two tiles on a single enemy tile to fully destroy it.

LARGE TILES
When you have three normal tiles in a line (either straight or diagonal),
you get a large tile. A large tile takes up 2x2 tiles.
A tile may only be used once in any direction to make a large tile.
It is not possible to create large tiles using large tiles.
